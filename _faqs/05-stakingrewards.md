We cannot directly estimate how much any given exchange wallet would receive over any given amount of time. However, as we employ a directly-proportional model of exchange rewards, we can say that you will be rewarded with approximately the same percentage of the incoming AMIS as you own of the staking population for any given period of time.

For example (JUST AN EXAMPLE): If you exchange 100 AMIS, and there is 1,000 AMIS total at stake across all exchange wallets, then you make 10% profit during the transaction. For any given block during the period of time while you are offering bids/asks, you will have a 10% chance to create the next valid trading transaction, and in turn gain the exchange reward.
