Right now AMIS is trading as an ERC20 token on the Ethereum / bitshares blockchains while we develop other AMIS side-blockchains. It will be exchanged at a ratio of 1:1 at mainnet. The process is simple, easy, and articulated when it comes time.

Upon release of mainnet, the Asset Management Instrument Solution (AMIS) will be a first of its kind, future-proof fast moving transactional vehicle which tackles intermediation paradigm in the digital era. Also included will be:

- A webwallet for a no-batteries-needed experience to use (just a browser like MEW)
- Desktop Apps (windows, mac, linux)
