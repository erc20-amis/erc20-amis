In cryptocurrency systems, keeping your private key(s) hidden is the most important thing in securing your funds.
Exchanging AMIS on the Ethereum network does not require you to share any secret information with anybody. Our sourcecode is open, so anyone can verify this.
Additionally, we will offer a means for 'secure online decentralized exchange' whereby users are able to exchange without ever having to expose their private key(s) to the world wide web.
